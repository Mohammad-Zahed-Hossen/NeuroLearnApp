Based on my analysis of the HolisticAnalyticsScreen.tsx and AnalyticsAggregationService.ts files, here's my assessment of the functionality:

Current Status
✅ HolisticAnalyticsScreen.tsx - Well Implemented
Complete React Native screen with professional UI
Proper imports and service integration
Good error handling and loading states
Interactive charts, animations, and adaptive UI
Correct navigation setup and export
⚠️ AnalyticsAggregationService.ts - Partially Implemented
Comprehensive service structure with proper interfaces
Good error handling and caching mechanisms
However, many methods are placeholders returning default values
Issues Found
The service has 11 methods returning 0 and 13 methods returning [] instead of actual calculations:

Placeholder Methods (returning 0):

calculateDeepWorkCapacity
calculateExerciseImpact
calculateHealthCognitiveCorrelation
calculateBudgetAdherence
calculateSavingsGrowthRate
calculateFinancialStressImpact
calculateFinancialGoalProgress
calculateDebtReductionRate
calculateNoiseImpact
calculateLightingImpact
Placeholder Methods (returning []):

calculatePerformanceByTimeOfDay
calculateCognitiveLoadTrend
calculateOptimalFocusWindows
analyzeDistractionPatterns
calculateOptimalPerformanceWindows
analyzeSpendingPatterns
calculateFinancialWellnessTrend
analyzeWeatherImpact
generateOptimalSchedule
detectAnomalies
predictFocusTrend
predictRetentionRisk
Functionality Assessment
The screen will load and display but will show default/empty data instead of meaningful analytics. The UI framework is solid, but the underlying calculations need implementation.

Next Steps
Would you like me to:

Implement the missing analytics calculations in the service to make it fully functional?
Test the current state by running the app to see the UI with placeholder data?
Focus on specific areas first (e.g., learning analytics, focus analytics, etc.)?
