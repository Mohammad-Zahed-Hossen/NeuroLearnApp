🚀 Performance Optimization Recommendations
Immediate Actions (High Impact)
Implement React Query Properly

// Add proper caching and background updates
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['finance-data', userId],
  queryFn: () => loadFinanceData(),
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
});

Copy
typescript
Add Skeleton Loading States

Replace loading spinners with skeleton screens

Improve perceived performance

Implement Component Memoization

const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() =>
    expensiveCalculation(data), [data]
  );
  return <Chart data={processedData} />;
});
