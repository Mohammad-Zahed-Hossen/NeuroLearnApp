## ðŸ§ª TESTING REQUIRED

### Critical Path Testing
1. **Navigation Flow**
   - [ ] Tab switching between Home, Learn, Focus, Profile
   - [ ] Hub screen navigation to sub-features
   - [ ] Back button handling
   - [ ] Deep linking to specific screens

2. **Cognitive Load Adaptation**
   - [ ] Force high cognitive load and verify tab hiding
   - [ ] Test UI mode switching (simple/normal/advanced)
   - [ ] Verify command filtering in simple mode
   - [ ] Test break suggestions

3. **Overlay Functionality**
   - [ ] FAB visibility and context adaptation
   - [ ] Command palette search and execution
   - [ ] Quick actions modal display
   - [ ] Gesture interactions

4. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Existing screen compatibility
   - [ ] Context provider integration
   - [ ] Storage service compatibility
   - [ ] Authentication flow

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Large dataset handling
- [ ] Memory usage with multiple overlays
- [ ] Animation smoothness
- [ ] Cognitive load calculation performance

## ðŸš€ BENEFITS ACHIEVED
