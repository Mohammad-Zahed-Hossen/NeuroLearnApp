Pixel-Mind-tech: @agent Enable: "Enable GPT-5 mini for all clients"

GitHub Copilot: I'll inspect key project files (package.json, README, and EAS/eas.json) to determine the exact build steps and scripts available; outcome: tailored build instructions for this workspace. I'll read them now.

Read [](file:///d%3A/Perflexity/NeuroLearnApp/package.json)

I'll open the README and eas.json to gather additional build notes and EAS config.

I'll read eas.json and `expo` or config if present to surface EAS build details.

I inspected package.json, README.md, and eas.json to learn the project’s scripts and recommended flows — next I’ll give a concise, tailored build guide for this workspace (including Windows-specific notes and exact PowerShell commands).

## Quick contract
- Inputs: your machine (Windows), installed SDKs, and repo checkout.
- Outputs: a runnable dev app (Expo), a debug APK, and options for a local or cloud release build.
- Success criteria: app boots in Expo (or emulator), debug APK builds, tests run.

## High-level steps
1. Verify prerequisites (Node, npm, Java, Android SDK, Expo/EAS).
2. Install dependencies.
3. Set environment variables (.env) and optional Supabase setup.
4. Run dev server or build native (Android) artifacts.
5. Run tests and prebuild checks.

## 1) Verify prerequisites (important)
Minimum versions in README:
- Node: >= 18.x
- npm: >= 9.x
- Android Studio + SDK 33+
- Java JDK (11 or 17 recommended)
- Expo CLI / EAS CLI for cloud builds

Check versions in PowerShell:
```powershell
node -v
npm -v
java -version
```

Check Android tooling (PowerShell):
```powershell
# ensure adb is available
adb --version

# if you use Android SDK path
echo $env:ANDROID_HOME
```

Notes:
- Several npm scripts call bash scripts (setup-env.sh, eas-build-pre-install.sh). On Windows you’ll need Git Bash, WSL, or adapt scripts to PowerShell. I can help convert them.
- iOS build requires macOS/Xcode; skip on Windows.

---

## 2) Install project dependencies
From repository root in PowerShell:
```powershell
npm install
```

If you get node-gyp or native compile errors, ensure Python/Visual Studio Build Tools are installed per the error messages.

---

## 3) Environment variables and setup scripts
Create .env (or copy from example if present):
```powershell
# If a .env.example exists
cp .env.example .env   # run from Git Bash or WSL, or copy manually in Explorer
```

Run the automated setup (note: `setup-env` uses `bash setup-env.sh`):
- If you have WSL or Git Bash:
```powershell
npm run setup-env
```
- If you don't have a bash shell on Windows, open Git Bash or WSL and run the same commands, or I can convert setup-env.sh to a cross-platform Node script.

Optional: set up Supabase functions / backend:
```powershell
npm run setup-backend
```
(This also uses `bash` — use a bash-capable shell or adapt.)

---

## 4) Development: Expo / emulator
Start the dev server (Metro) and the Expo app:
```powershell
npm start
# or
expo start
```

Run on Android emulator/device:
```powershell
npm run android
# this executes `expo run:android` to build and install on a connected device/emulator
```

Run on web:
```powershell
npm run web
```

If Metro cache issues occur:
```powershell
npx expo start --clear
```

---

## 5) Build an Android debug APK locally
This repo provides a safe Windows script for debug build:

Prebuild (generate native projects + custom gradle fixes):
```powershell
npm run prebuild-android
```
Note: `prebuild-android` runs `npx expo prebuild` then a Node gradle-fix script — that should be cross-platform.

Then build debug APK (Windows-safe script):
```powershell
npm run android-build
# runs: cd android && .\gradlew.bat clean assembleDebug
# resulting APK is under android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\
```

To launch the debug APK on an attached device:
```powershell
adb install -r android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

---

## 6) Build a release AAB/APK
Option A — Local Gradle (Windows):
- Open Android Studio -> build -> Generate Signed Bundle / APK (recommended for signing GUI).
- Or from command line (using gradlew.bat), in PowerShell:
```powershell
# From repo root
cd android
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
# or bundleRelease for AAB
.\gradlew.bat bundleRelease
```
Note: package.json has a `build:ci` script that uses `./gradlew assembleRelease` — on Windows prefer `.\gradlew.bat`.

Option B — EAS cloud builds (recommended for release and Play Store)
Install EAS CLI and authenticate:
```powershell
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login    # open browser, sign in to expo account
```
Start a cloud build (EAS profiles available in eas.json):
```powershell
# production profile -> AAB
eas build --platform android --profile production

# or preview / development profile
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```
If you prefer local EAS builder:
```powershell
npm run build:local
# runs: eas build --platform android --local
```
EAS will prompt for credentials / keystore setup if needed. Follow the interactive prompts or provide secrets via environment variables.

---

## 7) Tests and prebuild checks (quality gates)
Run unit tests:
```powershell
npm test
# or
npm run test:all
```

Run prebuild validation:
```powershell
npm run prebuild-check
npm run validate-audio-assets
```

Suggested verification steps after build:
- Expo dev: open app in device or simulator — check screens load.
- Debug APK: install and smoke-test critical flows.
- Run `npm test` and ensure tests pass.

---

## Edge cases & tips
- Windows + bash scripts: use Git Bash or WSL, or I can convert shell scripts to Node/PowerShell for cross-platform.
- Java version mismatch or missing Android SDK will break Gradle — install JDK 11/17 and set JAVA_HOME.
- If `expo prebuild` overwrites files or you already have android present, back up changes or run only the steps you need.
- For signing the release: either use Android Studio (recommended) or configure EAS to manage keystore.

---

## Small, safe improvements I can make for you (optional)
- Convert setup-env.sh and eas-build-pre-install.sh to cross-platform Node scripts so Windows users can run `npm run setup-env` from PowerShell.
- Add a `build:release:windows` npm script that uses `.\gradlew.bat` consistently.
- Help configure EAS credentials and upload keystore
