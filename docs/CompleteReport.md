### **‚ö†Ô∏è Static/Hardcoded Data That Should Be Dynamic**

#### **1. Finance Module**
```typescript
// src/screens/finance/FinanceDashboardScreen.tsx
const getStaticDemoData = () => {
  const demoTransactions: Transaction[] = [
    { id: '1', amount: 5000, category: 'income', description: 'Salary' },
    { id: '2', amount: 1200, category: 'food', description: 'Grocery shopping' },
    // ... more static data
  ];
}
```
**Problem**: Demo data is hardcoded, should come from real API

#### **2. Sleep Tracker**
```typescript
// src/screens/health/SmartSleepTracker.tsx
const getStaticDemoData = () => {
  const demoSleepLogs = [
    { id: '1', bedtime: '22:30', wakeTime: '07:00', duration: 8.5, quality: 4 },
    // ... more static sleep data
  ];
}
```
**Problem**: Sleep data is static, should come from real sensors or manual input

#### **3. Memory Palace**
```typescript
// src/screens/Learning Tools/MemoryPalaceScreen.tsx
const defaultPalaces: MemoryPalace[] = [
  {
    id: 'home-palace',
    name: 'Your Home',
    locations: [
      { id: '1', name: 'Front Door', description: 'The main entrance' },
      // ... more static locations
    ]
  }
]
```
**Problem**: Default palaces are hardcoded, should be created from user's real locations

#### **4. Wellness Dashboard**

// src/screens/wellness/WellnessDashboardScreen.tsx
const [wellnessData, setWellnessData] = useState({
  todayScore: 75,        // Static value
  sleepHours: 7.5,       // Static value
  workoutStreak: 3,      // Static value
  waterIntake: 6,        // Static value
  weeklyTrend: [65, 70, 68, 75, 80, 78, 75] // Static array
});
