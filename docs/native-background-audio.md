# iOS

To enable background audio on iOS (required for reliable playback when the app is backgrounded):

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Select the project target â†’ Capabilities.
3. Turn on "Background Modes" and check "Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture".

Alternatively, you can add the key to Info.plist (XML snippet):

````xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>audio</string>
</array>

## Testing

- Test on a physical device: start playback, lock the screen, and verify audio continues.
- Test switching away from the app and returning.

## Security & Privacy

- Continue to respect user privacy: ask for any permissions only if needed.
- Document background audio behavior in your app's privacy policy if you collect or transmit usage data.
1. Add permissions and service declaration to AndroidManifest.xml (inside the `<application>` element), for example:

```xml
<service android:name="com.some.player.TrackPlayerService" android:exported="false" />
````

2. Ensure your player library starts a foreground service when playing in background and supplies a persistent notification.

Notes:

- Android 8+ requires a foreground service for long-running background audio.
- If you plan to support lockscreen controls or media session integration, follow the track-player documentation.
