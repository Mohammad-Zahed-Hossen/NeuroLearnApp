## üöÄ PHASE 1: CRITICAL FIXES (READY FOR TESTING)

### ‚úÖ Status: IMPLEMENTED - READY FOR TESTING

### Fix 1: Physics Worker Stability
**File**: `src/services/learning/PhysicsWorkerManager.ts`
**Issue**: Worker URL resolution failing, causing crashes
**Solution**: Add fallback mechanisms

```typescript
// CURRENT ISSUE: Line 47-49
this.workerUrl = './workers/physicsWorker.js';
this.worker = new Worker(this.workerUrl);

// FIXED VERSION: Multiple fallbacks + graceful degradation
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Add multiple worker URL strategies (DONE)
2. ‚úÖ Add graceful fallback to main thread (DONE)
3. ‚è≥ Test worker initialization
4. ‚è≥ Verify physics still works

**Expected Result**: Zero physics-related crashes

### Fix 2: Store Selector Optimization
**File**: `src/hooks/useOptimizedSelectors.ts` (NEW)
**Issue**: Components re-render on any store change
**Solution**: Granular selectors

```typescript
// CURRENT PROBLEM:
const auraState = useAuraStore(state => state); // Re-renders on ANY change

// SOLUTION:
const context = useAuraContext(); // Only re-renders when context changes
const cognitiveLoad = useCognitiveLoad(); // Only when cognitive load changes
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Create optimized selector hooks (DONE)
2. ‚è≥ Replace store usage in 3 key components
3. ‚è≥ Measure re-render reduction
4. ‚è≥ Expand to all components

**Expected Result**: 50-70% reduction in re-renders

### Fix 3: Canvas Node Limiting
**File**: `src/components/ai/NeuralCanvas.tsx`
**Issue**: Rendering all nodes regardless of performance
**Solution**: Dynamic node limiting

```typescript
// CURRENT: Line 156
const visibleNodes = useMemo(() => {
  return nodes.filter(/* viewport check */);
}, [nodes, viewportBounds]);

// ENHANCED: Add performance-based limiting
const maxNodes = cognitiveLoad > 0.8 ? 50 : nodes.length;
return nodes.filter(/* viewport check */).slice(0, maxNodes);
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Add cognitive load-based limiting (DONE)
2. ‚è≥ Test with large graphs (1000+ nodes)
3. ‚è≥ Verify smooth interaction
4. ‚è≥ Add device capability detection

**Expected Result**: Smooth 60 FPS even with large graphs
